## EDIOrderForm

Window glass pane order application that takes order parameters from input and exports to XML files

## Motivation

Much of the manufacturing in the industry is being processed through machinery instead of manual labour. The use of optimizers (optimizing the glass cutter to use as much area as possible) in cutting glass was previously completed by manual entry, which is subject to errors and unusable data. These errors can result in delays in the manufacturing process, which is costly to the company.

## Solution

By creating an application that error-checks for invalid parameters, the manufacturing process can be smoothed out. The application automatically saves a XML file that contains the input parameters, which is then fed to the optimizer. This application provides the user (the client) with a user-friendly interface that allows for multiple orders to be entered in different tabs, as well as functions such as resequencing orders and deleting tabs. The application also checks for errors in the user's inputs. Parameters such as glass dimensions and glass types must be compatible with each other before the user can proceed with the next order. After the order is completely entered, the user simply needs to click 'export' and send the resulting XML file to Ultraseal.
